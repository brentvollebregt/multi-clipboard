# mutli-clipboard
switch clipboard contents using easily using a command 

The idea of this is to easily switch keyboards with simple commands. Map commands to keys to use this easily.

Images and text are supported and unlimited amounts of saved clipboards can be created.

## What This Does
This acts as a hotbar in a game would. When 1 is passed and you are currently using 2 (current is saved in data.json), your clipboard contents will be saved in 2 and 1 will then be loaded; if 1 hasn't been used before, the current clipboard is kept but the data is still saved to 2.

e.g.<br />
1: 123, 2: abc, clipboard: myclipboard<br />
When currently using is 1 and you pass 2:<br />
1: myclipboard, 2: abc, clipboard: abc

Clipboards can be named more than just numbers.

## Installation/Setup
1. Install PIL if you are using Python 3 ( `pip install Pillow` )
2. Install PYQT5 ( `pip install pyqt5` )
3. Install pywin32 ( `pip install pypiwin32` or [Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/))
4. Run the command on `clipboards.py`

## Usage
* `clipboards.py switch [clipboard]` - Will switch current clipboard to the clipboard specified
* `clipboards.py clear` - Clear all clipboards
* `clipboards.py clear 1` - Clear clipboard 1
* `clipboards.py view` - View all clipboards (opens GUI)
* `clipboards.py view 1` - Views clipboard 1

## GUI

![GUI Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brentvollebregt/mutli-clipboard/master/images/GUI_Example.jpg "GUI Example")

### Usage
* Click on clipboard to switch to it (auto close feature mentioned below)
* Right click menu on each clipboard
* Clear all clipboards option
* Easy refresh
* Can add from the GUI (will pick the lowest integer)
* Displays both text and images

### Features
* Dark stylesheet and transparent
* Dynamically displays contents of clipboards
* Will save current clipboard on startup (so you can see what the state it would be if it is switched)
* "close_on_gui_select" value (true/false) in data.json to close GUI when a a clipboard is selected when true

## Notes
I have included RunGUI.vbs to be attached to a hot key so the GUI can easily be opened
